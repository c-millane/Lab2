＃2.Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar?

＃Not really. The median is 70.0 and the mean is 71.7 (saw in summary(choco))

＃Most of the consumers like these kind coco precentage of chocolate bar.

＃The ratings doesn't depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar .

＃3 How do ratings compare across different company locations?

＃These three places have the same median, but the Q1 and Q3 are different.

＃The Q3 in rarting of France and USA are the same.

＃The Q1 in rarting of France and Canada are the same.
